# SoccerBot
The Soccer Bot is designed to participate in soccer-like robot competitions, where it can chase, capture, and shoot the ball towards a goal. Using a Bluetooth module, users can control the bot from a mobile app for real-time maneuvering on the field.

**Features**
Bluetooth Control: Control the bot using any compatible smartphone app that communicates via Bluetooth.
Four-Motor Drive System: Provides mobility and agility, allowing for fast movement, quick turns, and precise control.
3D-Printed Attachment: Designed in SolidWorks, the front attachment lets the bot grab the ball for control or push it to score goals.
Arduino Nano Based: Uses the Arduino Nano to process control commands and manage the motors.

**Components**
Arduino Nano - Microcontroller to control motors and Bluetooth communication.
Bluetooth Module - Provides Bluetooth communication with the smartphone app.
Motor Driver - Drives the four motors for omnidirectional movement.
Four DC Motors with Wheels - Controls the botâ€™s movement.
3D-Printed Front Attachment - Custom-designed attachment in SolidWorks to handle the ball.
